I \:)) love @Python!.  :))
He amused the children by showing them some magic. The children amused themselves by playing games. He amused the children by singing. He amused himself by reading a detective story after supper. He is a very angry person. She gets very angry in the morning. I am very angry, because you lied to me! ... He is angry, she is angry, everyone is angry today! ...
I feel victimized beacuse my current boyfriend cheated on me. But no I feel happy.
